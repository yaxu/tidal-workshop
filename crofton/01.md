# Looping sounds with TidalCycles

Using simple high (`h`) and low (`l`) drum sounds. Add a number from 1-8 to these, e.g. `h4` and `l4`.


```
sound "h l"
```

Add more sounds, and it'll squeeze them in to the same rhythmic 'cycle'

```
sound "h h h h l l l l"
```

You can use `~` to add gaps to add rhythms:

```
sound "h ~ l ~ h l ~"
```

You can use `*` and a number to play a sound multiple times (in the
time of one):

```
sound "h*2 ~ l ~ h l*4 ~"
```

The conga rhythm "Have you got a dog, great big dog."

```
sound "h*4 l h*2 l"
```

Another way to put multiple sounds inside one, with `[` and `]`:

```
sound "h [l l l]"

sound "[h h] [l ~ l l]"
```

# Changing the sounds with 'effects'


```
sound "h [l h] h ~"
```

Reverse the loop

```
rev $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Make it louder
```
louder $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Make it quieter
```
quieter $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Make it quiet!
```
mute $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Send it to the left
```
left $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Send it to the right
```
right $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Make it higher pitched
```
higher $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Make it lower pitched
```
lower $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Make it sound 'scratchy'
```
scratch $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

# Conditionals

Do something every given number of loops, for example every third loop:
```
every 3 higher $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Do something.. sometimes!
```
sometimes scratch $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```


# More sounds to try

* arpy - notes
* can
* dbass - low sounds
* bd - bass drum
* sd - snare drum
* hc - high hat closed
* ho - high hat open
* rs - rim shot
* cp - hand clap
* kurt - strange noises
* sid - bleepy sounds?
* donk
* amencutup

Add `:` and a number to find different variations of a sound, e.g. `sound "kurt:3 sid:2"`.

But work together to find sounds that work well together!
