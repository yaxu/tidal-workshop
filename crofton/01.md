# Tidal

Welcome to this workshop on tidalcycles, known as *tidal* for short.

Rough schedule for day one:

## Morning

* Background to live coding
* Thinking about patterns
* Simple looping
* More complicated rhythms

## Afternoon

* Quipu
* Transforming patterns

# Looping sounds with TidalCycles

Using simple high (`h`) and low (`l`) drum sounds.

```
sound "h l"
```

Add more sounds, and it'll squeeze them in to the same rhythmic 'cycle'

```
sound "h h h h l l l l"
```

You can use `~` to add gaps to add rhythms:

```
sound "h ~ l ~ h l ~"
```

You can use `*` and a number to play a sound multiple times (in the
time of one):

```
sound "h*2 ~ l ~ h l*4 ~"
```

The conga rhythm "Have you got a dog, great big dog."

```
sound "h*4 l h*2 l"
```

Another way to put multiple sounds inside one, with `[` and `]`:

```
sound "h [l l l]"

sound "[h h] [l ~ l l]"
```

## Changing the sounds with simple 'effects'


```
sound "h [l h] h ~"
```

Reverse it

```
rev $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Make it louder
```
louder $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Send it to the left
```
left $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```

Send it to the right
```
right $ sound "h [l h l] h l"
```
