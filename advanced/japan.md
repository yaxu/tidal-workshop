# Introduction

TidalCycles is a language for the exploration of pattern.

What is a pattern? How can we explore them as code? In this workshop
we will explore some advanced topics, to try to understand what that
means. I'm not sure myself, but lets try.

I have been making a new version of TidalCycles for these workshops,
so we can try something new. It's version 1.0-pre, which is not
officially released, but works and has some exciting new features. You
can install it with this command in a terminal window:

```
cabal install http://slab.org/tokyo/tidal-1.0.0-pre.tar.gz
```

If you want to uninstall it again you can run this command:

```
ghc-pkg unregister tidal-1.0.0
```
