# Introduction

TidalCycles is a language for the exploration of pattern.

What is a pattern? How can we explore them as code? In this workshop
we will explore some advanced topics, to try to understand what that
means. I'm not sure myself, but lets try.

We will use TidalCycles version 1.0-pre, which is not yet released and
has some new features.
