# Introduction

Welcome to this workshop on tidalcycles, known as *tidal* for short.

I'm Alex - alex@slab.org + http://slab.org/

Rough schedule for the two days:

Morning session: 9.30 - 12.30, 13.30 - 16:30

With natural breaks for tea drinking..

Join us at Pharmacia from 9pm on Tuesday.

## What is a cycle?

* Cyclic notion of time from Indian Classical music
* The end is also the beginning (the *sam*)
* Time in Tidal is based on cycles, rather than beats
* Cycles are ticking over all the time
* Cycles have fixed duration (which you can change with the *cps* command)

## Background

* TOPLAP
* Algorave

## Pattern

Types of pattern:

* Repetition
* Symmetry
* Interference
* Randomness/glitch

# Basics of (polyrhythmic) sequencing with Tidal

Before we get hands on, lets look at some visual renderings of tidal patterns.

Sequences in tidal are generally denoted with double quotes:

```{.haskell render="colour" cycles=6}
"red pink"
```

You can 'read' the above diagram clockwise, from the top. You can see
that the pattern repeats once per cycle. Six cycles are shown, but it
will go on for ever. Here's what happens if we add another element to the sequence:


```{.haskell render="colour" cycles=6}
"red pink blue"
```

You can see that the elements have got shorter, so that they fit into
the space. This already demonstrates how tidal is about cycles, not beats.

## Make a sound

Lets make a sound.

Make sure supercollider is running, and SuperDirt is running inside
that (via the `SuperDirt.start` command, which you can put in the
supercollider startup file so it automatically runs).

Run the following in atom, via ctrl-Enter (or on a mac, cmd-Enter):

```
d1 $ sound "bd"
```

Stop making a sound!

```
d1 silence
```

Tip: Make sure your tidal patterns have an empty line a

Lets break that down..

* `d1` is a connection to the sound synthesiser, SuperDirt. There is also `d2`, up to `d9` or so.
* `$` passes what's on the right (`sound "bd"`) to what's on the left
  (`d1`). Without this, Tidal would only read as far as `sound` and
  get confused!
* `sound` says that a pattern of sounds (samples or synths) is coming up. That is, it turns a pattern of words into a pattern of sounds.
* `"bd"` is a pattern of words, in this case the single word `bd`,
  refering to a bass drum sound sample somewhere on your computer.
