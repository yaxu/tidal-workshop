# Introduction

## What is a cycle?

* Cyclic notion of time from Indian Classical music
* The end is also the beginning (the *sam*)
* Time in Tidal is based on cycles, rather than beats
* Cycles are ticking over all the time
* Cycles have fixed duration (which you can change with the *cps* command)

# Basics of polyrhythmic sequencing with Tidal

Before we get hands on, lets look at some visual renderings of Tidal patterns.

```{.haskell render="colour"}
"red pink"
```

# Introduction to patterns - repetition, symmetry, interference and glitch

# Haskell syntax

# Ensemble play

# More complex patternings

# Strategies for live coding performance

# Composing with tidal

# Superdirt - synths, customisation, multichannel, midi control

# Visualisation
