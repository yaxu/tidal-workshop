# Introduction

Welcome to this workshop on tidalcycles, known as *tidal* for short.

## What is a cycle?

* Cyclic notion of time from Indian Classical music
* The end is also the beginning (the *sam*)
* Time in Tidal is based on cycles, rather than beats
* Cycles are ticking over all the time
* Cycles have fixed duration (which you can change with the *cps* command)

# Basics of polyrhythmic sequencing with Tidal

Before we get hands on, lets look at some visual renderings of tidal patterns.

Sequences in tidal are generally denoted with double quotes:

```{.haskell render="colour"}
"red pink"
```

You can 'read' the above diagram clockwise, from the top.

```{.haskell render="colour"}
"red pink blue"
```
