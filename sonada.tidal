-- Sequencing

d1 $ sound "bd sd cp sd"

-- Silencing

d1 $ silence

-- The longer the sequence, the faster it runs

d1 $ sound "bd sd cp sd cp cp"

-- Euclidean rhythms

(2,5) : A thirteenth century Persian rhythm called Khafif-e-ramal.
(3,4) : The archetypal pattern of the Cumbia from Colombia, as well as a Calypso rhythm from Trinidad.
(3,5,2) : Another thirteenth century Persian rhythm by the name of Khafif-e-ramal, as well as a Rumanian folk-dance rhythm.
(3,7) : A Ruchenitza rhythm used in a Bulgarian folk-dance.
(3,8) : The Cuban tresillo pattern.
(4,7) : Another Ruchenitza Bulgarian folk-dance rhythm.

-- Add gaps

d1 $ sound "bd ~ hh bd sd ~ hh bd"

-- Pick from a sampleset

d1 $ sound "arpy arpy:4 arpy:5"

-- Where do these sounds come from?

-- In the menus in SuperCollider (not atom):
-- - File > Open user support directory > downloaded-quarks > Dirt-Samples

-- How do I add more sounds? Here's some..

-- Composing effects

d1 $ sound "bd sd cp sd"
   # vowel "a e"

-- Types

:t (+)
:t slow
:t fast
:t sound
:t (#)
:t ($)

-- Lets look at slow

slow :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a

-- Slow takes a pattern of time, a pattern (of something) and results in a pattern (of that something)

d1 $ slow 2 (sound "arpy arpy:2")

-- We have to wrap that last pattern in brackets so that it gets passed as the second parameter of `slow`.

-- Instead we can do this:

d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "arpy arpy:2"

-- The $ means 'pass everything on the right, to the function on the
-- left'. It saves having to remember to put the closing bracket in.
-- `d1` is a function as well, which takes exactly one pattern, which
-- it sends to the synthesiser. We could do this instead:

d1 (slow 2 (sound "arpy arpy:2"))

-- .. but we'd quickly end up with a lot of closing brackets to keep
-- track of.

-- Earlier we noticed that the first parameter was a *pattern* of
-- time. This means we can pattern it:

d1 $ slow "2 0.5" $ sound "arpy arpy:2"

-- There are a lot of patterns in the above! Lets look at the bits.

-- This is a pattern of words (also known as 'strings'):
"arpy arpy:2"

-- This is a pattern of names of sounds:
sound "arpy arpy:2"

-- This is a pattern of whole numbers (also known as 'integers'):
"2 4"

-- This isn't actually a pattern, but a function that takes a pattern as input, and returns a slowed down pattern
slow "2 4"

-- This isn't a pattern either, but a strange little function that
-- takes everything on the right and gives it to the function on the
-- left:
$

-- But it together and you get a pattern again, a pattern of sounds
slow "2 4" $ sound "arpy arpy:2"

-- This is also a function, that takes a pattern as input and starts
-- sending it off to the synthesiser to be turned into sound.
d1

-- There's another one of these dollars to take everything on the right and pass it to d1
$

-- And the whole thing, which is an action to change what is being sent to the synthesiser
d1 $ slow "2 4" $ sound "arpy arpy:2"

-- Functions like "slow" will work on any pattern. We could have
-- slowed down the pattern of words rather than the pattern of sounds:

-- Playing long samples

-- legato

-- loopAt

-- Granular Synthesis

-- every

-- off

-- sometimes

-- hurry

-- vis

-- installing on a mac:
brew install cairo
brew install pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-vis.git
cd tidal-vis
cabal install

import Sound.Tidal.Vis

import Sound.Tidal.VisCycle

import qualified Graphics.Rendering.Cairo as C

let vis name pat = vLines (C.withSVGSurface) (name ++ ".svg") (600,50) pat 1 1

vis "test" $ "red blue green orange"

visCycle "testcycle" "" "red blue green orange"
